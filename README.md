# Substance classification for Sewers (**SC_sewers**)

## Substance classification for Sewers

The objective is to develop a model for the substance classification of sewer systems that has the following properties [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Karsten Kerres]:

  1. The methodology and result must meet the requirements of operators and users in terms of practicality. 
  2. The calculation basis for the substance classification must consider the generally available data from operators and users.
  3. For reasons of acceptance, the methodology for substance classification should have the most significant possible analogies to the method of condition classification according to DWA-M 149-3 (DWA, 2015a). 
  4. The substance assessment should also be based on the damage coding according to DIN EN 13508-2 (DIN EN, 2011) or DWA-M 149-2 (DWA, 2013b).
  5. The derived calculation method must be robust to fluctuations in data quality.
  6. From the substance class, it should be possible to deduce which (main) rehabilitation methods can be used to technically and economically rehabilitate a sewer or manhole and what rehabilitation effort is expected.
  7. The methodology must be structured to link with other urban infrastructures to implement a multi-sectoral strategy with adequate adaptation.
